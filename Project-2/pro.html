        @everyone - PBUYðŸ˜† 1. I am not pleased with the general attitude of the
        frontend track, all the recordings over the past one week no one has
        gone back to view or relearn one or two things. This could mean either
        of two things: a. we understand everything taught in class b. we don't
        really want to accept we haven't mastered things yet. whichever one it
        is it's a wrong notion. Just like I said on our punctuality and
        attendance. This is also likely the last time I will comment about this
        attitude. The floor is opened for people to cite their difficulties and
        all.

        appropriate way.
