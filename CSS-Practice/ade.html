      <p class="head">Dear Vicky,</p>
      <p class="para-1">I hope this letter finds you in the best of Spirits.</p>
      <p id="para-2">
        When I visited you last week, you seemed a bit depressed. Come on boy,
        you should thank Almighty Allah for giving you a fresh lease of life. I
        talked to your Doctor this Morning and he told me that you are now out
        of danger. You will have to remain in the hospital for a few more days
        but that is not something you should be concerned about. Don't forget
        that life is a mixture of Sorrowss and Joys.
      </p>

      <p id="para-3">
        By the way, all of us decided to celebrate your recovery. We will be
        throwing a small party till the day you come back from hospital.
      </p>

      <p id="para-4">See you soon.</p>
      <p id="para-5">Kind regards,</p>
      <p id="para-6">AbdulWakeel</p>
